    "# RAVER Simulations: A Jupyter Notebook Approach (v1)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This Notebook is an exploratory implementation of simulations for the Rated Validator Effectiveness Rating (RAVER) methodology. RAVER is a reputation system developed by Rated Protocol to quantify the performance of validators and their operators on the Ethereum network.\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary goal of this notebook is to rapidly prototype and validate our understanding of the RAVER calculation logic across different versions, experiment with data generation scenarios, and explore various analysis and visualization techniques. This self-contained environment allows us to iterate quickly and refine our approach before transitioning to a more structured and modular implementation."

    "## Notebook Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Library Imports**: We begin by importing the required Python libraries, including NumPy for numerical operations, Pandas for data manipulation, and Matplotlib for visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **RAVER Calculation Functions**: This section defines the core functions for calculating proposer effectiveness, attester effectiveness, and the overall RAVER score based on the specific formulas and logic outlined in the RAVER methodology documentation. We start with the implementation for RAVER v1.0 and will expand to include additional versions as we progress.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Sample Data Generation**: To test and validate our RAVER calculations, we need realistic sample data representing various validator performance scenarios. The `generate_sample_data` function is a basic implementation that generates sample proposal and attestation data for a specified number of validators and periods. As we iterate, we will enhance this component to model more complex scenarios, including high and low performance, edge cases, and potential real-world operator behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Run Simulation**: In this section, we call the `generate_sample_data` function to obtain a sample dataset and pass the resulting proposals and attestations to the RAVER calculation functions. The outputs (proposer effectiveness, attester effectiveness, and overall RAVER scores) are stored in a Pandas DataFrame for further analysis and visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Analysis and Visualization**: This is where we explore different techniques to gain insights from the simulation results. Initially, we create histogram plots to visualize the distributions of proposer effectiveness, attester effectiveness, and RAVER scores across all validators. We also plot a time series view of the RAVER scores for the top-performing validators to observe their score progressions over time. Additional analysis and visualization cells can be added as needed, such as exploring correlations between metrics, comparing validators grouped by performance tiers, and more.\n"
